## How to build

To build this project, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.
Optionally, you can also install [pngquant](https://pngquant.org) and
[prepa](https://github.com/undecidabot/prepa) to enable asset optimization.

Once everything is set up, simply run `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
This will download the necessary assets from the [Stardew Valley Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com),
and generate the result in a directory named `public`.
